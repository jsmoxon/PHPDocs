#Getting Started with PHP

Sauce Labs is a cloud platform for executing automated and manual mobile and web tests. Sauce Labs supports running automated tests with Selenium WebDriver (for web applications) and Appium (for native and mobile web applications).

In this tutorial we discuss how to run a test with Selenium WebDriver on Sauce Labs.

##Prerequisites

You must have PHP set up on your system before you start testing. You can find instructions for setting up PHP on Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other operating systems at [PHP.net](http://php.net/). Windows users must enable PHP curl library and OpenSSL support for the PHP setup to perform optimally. 

*For more information, see [Installing Extensions for Windows](http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.extensions.php).*

You will need to complete these setup tasks before running automated tests on Sauce Labs:

* Set up PHP
* Enable PHP curl library (for Windows operating system only)
* Set up curl/OpenSSL support for PHP (for Windows operating system only)
* Sausage Setup

###Setting up PHP

This section provides information about setting up PHP on your system with Windows operating system. For more information about setting up PHP on other operating systems, see [Installation and Configuration of PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php).

1. Download the latest thread-safe zip archive of the PHP binaries from [PHP Windows Downloads](http://windows.php.net/download/).
2. Extract the content of the downloaded archive to C:\PHP.
3. From the command prompt, navigate to C:\PHP and prepare the php.ini file using these commands.

```
cd C:\PHP
```

```
copy php.ini-development php.ini
```

###Enabling PHP curl Library

To enable the PHP curl library, edit the C:\PHP\php.ini file and uncomment each of these lines by removing the semi-colon (;)  that precedes them:

```
extension_dir = "ext"
extension=php_curl.dll
extension=php_openssl.dll
```

###Setting Up curl/OpenSSL Support for PHP

__PHP for Windows does not ship with very good SSL support.__

1. Right-click mk-ca-bundle.vbs.
2. From the context menu, select Save link as... and save the ```mk-ca-bundle.vbs``` file to your C:\ directory.
3. From the command prompt, execute mk-ca-bundle.vbs file using this command:
```
C:\>mk-ca-bundle.vbs
```
4. In the [PHP] section of the PHP.ini file, add this line of code:
```
curl.cainfo = c:\ca-bundle.crt
```
5. Save and close the PHP.ini file.

###Setting up Sausage on Windows
Sausage is a PHP framework that you can use with the Sauce Labs REST API. It is a set of classes and libraries that make it easy for you to run Selenium tests, either locally or on Sauce Labs. Sausage offers many additional features for free, like automatic pass/fail reporting. While we don’t recommend any specific 3rd party library, we’ve used Sausage for our samples as an easy reference. 

Sausage comes bundled with Paratest (for running your tests in parallel) and optionally Sauce Connect (for testing locally-hosted sites with Sauce).

These instructions are for setting up Sausage on a  Windows operating system. For more information about setting up Sausage on other operating systems, see [Sausage Setup](https://github.com/jlipps/sausage).

1. Right-click [givememysausage.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlipps/sausage-bun/master/givememysausage.php).
2. From the context menu, select Save link as... and save the givememysausage.php file to your project directory.
3. Navigate to your project directory in the command prompt and execute givememysausage.php file using this command:

```
php givememysausage.php -t YOUR_USERNAME YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
```

This downloads Sausage and all its dependences (PHPUnit for instance). The Sausage set up might take a few minutes. The set up checks for a number of requirements and if any are not met, notification messages are displayed on your screen. Fix the issues, if any, and then run installation command again. 
We also recommend using Sausage as your PHP framework if you’re running on Windows. This framework contains classes and libraries that are designed to work with the Sauce Labs API. It provides a convenient user interface and other features for managing your test results. For more information about how to set up and use Sausage, see [Sausage Documentation](http://github.com/jlipps/sausage).

We also recommend that you use Sauce Connect if you plan to test locally or behind a firewall. For more information, see [Sauce Connect documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/).

###Setting up Sausage on Mac/Linux
1. Create your project directory using the following command.
```
mkdir ~/sauce-tutorial && cd ~/sauce-tutorial
```
2. Use the following curl command to download and install Sausage using your username and your Sauce access key.
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlipps/sausage-bun/master/givememysausage.php |
SAUCE_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY php

```

This downloads Sausage on the respective operating system.

##Quick Start
Now that you have PHP and Sausage in place, let's try running a simple test to make sure that everything works.

If you’re on a Windows system, run this command from your project directory:
```
vendor\bin\phpunit.bat WebDriverDemo.php
```
If you’re on a Mac/Linux system, run this command from your project directory:
```
vendor/bin/phpunit WebDriverDemo.php
```
This starts the PHPUnit test runner. You might not see any output right away, but eventually you will see a series of dots inching across the screen. Each of these dots represents a test that successfully passed. Tests with errors or failed tests are represented by printing an E or an F respectively.

You should be able to see each test as it queues, runs, and finishes on your [Dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard). You will notice that each test has a name. This information is sent automatically by Sausage at the beginning of each test. Sausage also automatically notifies Sauce of the status of your tests after they are complete.

###Code Example
Now let’s take a look at some simple PHP code. In this example, we define a set of browsers to use, and run a simple check to make sure that clicking the link gets us to the expected new page. This simple example contains everything needed to run an automated test on Sauce Labs.

Integrating Sauce is simple. We add a set of desired capabilities, and point to a different Selenium server on the Sauce cloud. We will need to augment the server address with your Sauce username and access key to ensure secure access to the tests you run.

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

define('SAUCE_HOST', SAUCE_USERNAME.':'.SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY.'@ondemand.saucelabs.com');

class WebTest extends PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase
{
 protected $start_url = 'http://saucelabs.com/test/guinea-pig';
  
 public static $browsers = array(
        array(
            'browserName' => 'firefox',
            'host' => SAUCE_HOST,
            'port' => 80,
            'desiredCapabilities' => array(
                'version' => '15',
                'platform' => 'Windows 2012'
            )
        )
    );
 
    protected function setUp()
    {
        $this->setBrowserUrl('');  
    }

    public function testTitle()
    {
        $this->url($this->start_url);
        $this->assertContains("I am a page title", $this->title());
    }
}
?>
```

Note that in this example, we assume these values are stored in PHP constants (SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY respectively), defined wherever you like.

So you can see, getting started on Sauce with your existing tests is really quite simple.

##Running Tests Against Local Applications

If your test application is not publicly available, you will need to use Sauce Connect so that Sauce can reach it.

Sauce Connect is a tunneling app that allows you to execute tests securely when testing behind firewalls or on localhost. For more detailed information, please visit see the [Sauce Connect docs](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/).

##Running Tests in Parallel
Now that you’re running tests on Sauce, you may wonder how you can run your tests faster. One way to increase speed is by running tests in parallel across multiple virtual machines.

Note: Tests can be run in parallel at two levels, and you can run your tests in parallel across multiple browsers. For example, if you have 10 tests and want to run on five browsers this would be parallelism of five. You can also run tests across browsers and each test in parallel. Using our previous example this would be more like 50 parallel tests. Doing this requires that your tests are written in a way that they do not collide with one another. For more on this see the Selenium WebDriver - [Running Your Tests in Parallel](https://saucelabs.com/selenium/selenium-webdriver) blog.

###Parallel Tests in PHPUnit
Since PHPUnit doesn't have built-in parallel test execution, we can work around this by using Paratest, a command line tool for running PHPUnit that is bundled with Sausage. Let's try running some tests in parallel using Paratest.

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
/*For Mac/Linux operating system*/
vendor/bin/paratest -p 2 -f --phpunit=vendor/bin/phpunit WebDriverDemo.php
```

```
/*For Windows operating system*/
vendor\bin\paratest.bat -p 2 -f --phpunit=vendor\bin\phpunit.bat WebDriverDemo.php
```

This command specifies the path to the test file we want to run and tells Paratest that we want to simultaneously run two instances of PHPUnit.

Your tests should run approximately twice as fast as before. You can see the test running simultaneously on your Sauce tests page. Depending on your Sauce account level, consider increasing the number of processes to speed things up even more.

By default tests running in parallel may be executed in any order. In the next section we'll talk about this and discuss some tips for avoiding potential snags while speeding up test suites using parallelism.

##Best Practices
You can implement the following best practices to enhance the user experience while using Sauce Labs with PHP.
* Automatic Test Naming
* Automatic Test Status Reporting
* Automatic Authorized Link Generation
* Using Build IDs
* Using SpinAsserts

###Automatic Test Naming
By default, Sauce Labs doesn't know how to display the name of your test. Sausage comes up with a good name ```(TestClass::testFunction)``` and reports it with your test so it's easy to find on your tests page.

###Automatic Test Status Reporting
By default there is e no way for Sauce Labs to know whether a particular test was passed or failed. Sausage catches any failed assertions and reports the status of the test to Sauce after it's complete. As you're looking at your log of tests you can easily see which passed and which failed.

###Automatic Authorized Link Generation
Upon test failure, Sausage generates an authorized link to the failed job report on the Sauce Labs website, to facilitate reporting to people who need to know the details of the test. The job remains private (unless you change the status yourself), but others can follow the link without needing to log in with your credentials.

###Using Build IDs
If you're running your tests as part of your build, you can define a build ID, either by updating the browser arrays to include a 'build' parameter, or (more reasonably), defining an environment variable SAUCE_BUILD, like so:

```
SAUCE_BUILD=build-1234 vendor/bin/phpunit MyAwesomeTestCase.php
```

###Using SpinAsserts
SpinAsserts are really useful as well. Luckily, Sausage comes with a SpinAssert framework built in. Let's say we want to perform a check and we're not exactly sure how quickly the state will change to what we want. We can do this:

```php
public function testSubmitComments()
{
    $comment = "This is a very insightful comment.";
    $this->byId('comments')->click();
    $this->keys($comment);
    $this->byId('submit')->submit();
    $driver = $this;

    $comment_test = function() use ($comment, $driver) {
        return ($driver->byId('your_comments')->text() == "Your comments: $comment");
    };

    $this->spinAssert("Comment never showed up!", $comment_test);
}
```
This will submit a comment and wait for up to 10 seconds for the comment to show up before declaring the test failed.

The spinWait function is similar, and allows you to wait for a certain condition without necessarily asserting anything.
